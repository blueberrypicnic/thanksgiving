      <h1>Tracking the major holiday storms set to hit the US</h1>
          <p class="author">By Gobble-Gobble-Gobble</p>
          <p>The first storm that we have been tracking that moved from the Plains to the East Coast Tuesday and Wednesday is now moving off the New England coast and will be clearing out soon.</p>
          <p>A few rain and snow showers continue to impact parts of <span class="CharOverride-1">New England from upstate New York to Maine</span> this morning </p>
          <p>The main issue now is the winds behind the storm -- <span class="CharOverride-2">Wind Alerts</span> are in effect from North Carolina to New Jersey for 30 to 50 mph. </p>
          <p>New York City is not under a Windy Advisory at the moment but winds are still quite gusty. This morning gusts have already reached near 31 mph. Later this morning gusts could reach 35 to 40 mph during Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade so we will have to see what they decide to do about the floats.</p>
          <p>Twenty states from California to Michigan are under alert as the major storm out West continues to bring heavy mountain snow, blizzard conditions ice, flooding rain, and gusty winds across the region. </p>
          <p>Parts of California, Arizona, and new Mexico are under Flash Flood Watch as rounds of heavy rain are expected to continue there today through Friday. Flash flooding and debris flow is possible during the heaviest downpours. </p>
          <p>Winter Storm Warnings are in effect from the Sierras to the Central and Southern Rockies where heavy mountain snow is forecast Thursday to Friday, locally 2 to possibly more than 4 feet of snow in the highest elevations.</p>
